NOTE: Be sure, when you are searching that they are logical defintions, that is
they are definitions that relate to math and Logic.

Example
* Superman Cannot be jumping really high
** identify
Superman is sometimes debated around his flying abilities
Some say that he is merely jumping and due to his speed and 
strength it appears to you and I that he is merely jumping and
moving his body to go up and down after that.
** Define
This is obviously false.  Superman is indeed levitating and not
Jumping
** Example/Explanation
If Superman were jumping when he catches Lois Lane she would be cut in half
due to the speed and trajectory of superman being the man of steel. This is because
he would have to slow/stop to the same speed as Lois to catch her and then "rejump".
He visually does not appear to be 'rejumping' and Lois isnt cut in half.  DONE!
** Non-Trivial Test question
What would be the best way to describe Superman's flight


a. He jumps and with his strength and speed is able to alter his path
** Identify:
Some people are mistaking a change in speed to also mean a change in directon.
Even though a change in speed changes velocity, a change in velocity does not necessarily 
   lead to a change in direction. 
** Define   
Speed does not change direction.
** Example/Explanation 
   Velocity is a combination of speed and direction. One can change speed without
  changing direction. Similarly, direction can be altered without a change in speed. 

b. He flys like a bird and flaps his wings
** Identify:
    Some might think that since superman is mistaken for a bird when he flys,
    he flaps his "wing"s like a bird too.
** Define:
    This is false, superman does not flap his wings like a bird but only
    looks like a bird from far away.
** Example/Explanation
  Whenever superman is in a closeup, he is seen with his arms ourstretched.
** Non-Trivial Test question
  His flying is not based on aerodynamics so it is unecessary for him to flap
  his wings. 

c. He levitates, he's an alien "HEELLLLLOOOO!"
** Identify
  Some believe that superman levitates.
** Define
 This must be true, superman is levitating.
** Example/Explanation
  Since superman's flight is not based on aerodynamics, and he's not jumping, he is levitating.
  In one shot, superman is seen floating in the sky with Louis Lane. 

d. Why do I care about Superman again, he's in the D.C. universe ... so dark and terrible movies!
** Identify 
Some people are forgetting the significance of superman because D.C. makes dark movies and unfortunately
  superman is in the D.C. universe. People are judging superman based on the universe he is in. Since D.C. doesn't make good
  movies, the public would say "What good can come from D.C?"
** Define 
 Judging a character based on their environment is faulty logic. 
** Example/Explanation
Superman was once a beloved hero when he was first created. Superman came about as a personification of America and its role
in World War II. Superman gave people hope and gave something for soldiers and the public to read to forget about their troubles.
I believe that the D.C. universe is a good place for superman to be. His bright costume and good intentions strongly contrast
with D.C.'s dark and hostile flavor.
Take Joseph who was sold to Potipher for example. Joseph, in prison, was in a dark and terrible place. This environment
with all of its temptations made Joseph's riteousness and perseverance all the brighter. 



* Contrapositive

** Non-Trivial Test Question

* Consequent
** Define
   The second half of a proposition, whenever it's the then-clause.
** Example
   In the statement: "If it is raining, then I will need an umbrella." "I will need an umbrella" is the consequent.
   In logical notation, this is often referred to as q; as used in the p->q statement, which means if p then q.
